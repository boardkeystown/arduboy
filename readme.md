# Arduboy

These are a number of demo projects I've tossed together while playing with the Arduboy. Feel free to use the source code you find here.

What's here:

## Demo3D

A simple 3D vector drawing demo which renders a handful of cubes on the display. You can rotate using the arrow keys, and move the boxes closer or farther using the A and B buttons on the pad.

## Timer

A simple timer application which provides split-second timing, as well as lap timing.
